1. [The Power Sum]
   Step1: 1. Find all the valid [power number] and put them into array;
          2. Find the [maximum amount] (that power number can sum together and the final sum value <=X);
          3. From 1 to [maximum amount], during each iteration, find how many combinations amount to X;
             and sum all these values from each iteration.
             Recursion function must be written to reach every possible combination.	
2. [Stone Division, Revisited]
   Solve task in iterative way, starts from the smallest number in S array, then calculae bigger number which
   will use the result of the smaller number; this solution works efficiently both in time and space.
