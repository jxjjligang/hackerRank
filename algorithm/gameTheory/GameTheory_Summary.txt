1. [Alice and Bob's Silly Game]
   The idea is straightforward - count the [Prime Number] with range of N.
   Use Sieve algorithm to quickly flag [Prime Numbers].
   
2. [bob And Ben]   
   After learn [Sprague-Grundy Theorem], [Nimbers and Mex] from [GeeksforGeeks], I can complete this task.

3. [Game of Stones]
   Easy, use iterative idea, starts from known results and accumulate to the final result.

4. [Mis√®re Nim]
   Read discussion to solve the task.
   (1). If player 1 starts with an xor value of zero, player 1 loses unless the piles are: [1,1], [1,1,1,1], etc.
   (2). If player 1 starts with an xor value other than zero, player 1 wins unless the piles are: [1], [1,1,1], etc.

5. [Nimble Game]
   Read discussion to solve the task.
   (1). The ith square has i squares (0 1 2 .... i-1) before it, so for each coin in current square you actually has i ways to move, so it's like having i stones in a standard nim    
        game. The coins aren't the stones in the Nim's term. The slots before the current square are.
   (2). The number of coins in each square is just a flag, if initially some square has even number of coins, no matter what the first player did, all the changes can be cancel out 
        by puting all rest of the coins in current square (will be an odd number) to the same set of squares the first player put onto.
