1. [Red Knight's Shortest Path]
   Straightforward, just use BFS to find the shortest path from all possible moves.
   
2. [Hackerland Radio Transmitters]
   The logic is clear, all below steps are in while loop, exit when houses array is empty:
   1. Order houses by their location value in ascending way.
   2. Find a transmitter (the far right house that can be reached by the first house location value plus transmitter range), then push that transmitter into array.
   3. Remove all the houses that will be covered by the transmitter found in step 2.
