1. [Encryption]
   Simple: just follow the steps from the [problem description].
   
2. [Bigger is Greater]
   Straightforward, 2 levels of iteration will solve it.
   
3. [Climbing the Leaderboard]   
   Straightforward, create a ordered array and use binary search to find the rank position.
   
4. [Non-Divisible Subset]
   Use the code from discussion, this challenge is more about techniuqe skills although I have already observed 
   below three points:
   (1). Map the original array to its remainder value (modulo to k) array;
   (2). Count above array by its value (from 0 to k-1), this creates [Remainder Count Array];
   (3). The number at index 0 (remainder value is 0) can be [at most 1].

   Then, it should use below techniuqes:
   (4). If k is even number, then value at index k/2 of [Remainder Count Array] can be [at most 1];
   (5). Starts from index 1 of [Remainder Count Array], compare its value with its offset index value, 
        set index value to 0 if its value is less than its offset index value.
        1 to k-1, 2 to k-2, etc, this is how the index corresponds to its [offset index]. 
   (6). Reduce above array in step 5 by sum all its value, return the sum value.

5. [Larry's Array]
   Count the inversion in permutation array, return final result based on the count value is even or not.
   
6. [Organizing Containers of Balls]
   Key points:
   (1). Count the ball count by their type [from column], save the [count value] and its frequency.
   (2). Count the ball count by row [from row], save the [count value] and its frequency. 
   Compare if above 2 map equal, if equal then returns true otherwise returns false.   

7. [Absolute Permutation]
   Keypoint: figure out (n % (2*k)) === 0, then it will be easy to find how to make numbers
   meet the [Absolute Permutation] requirement.
