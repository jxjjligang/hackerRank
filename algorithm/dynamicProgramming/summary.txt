[Lego Blocks]
Key Points: 
    (1). Starts from the basic case (only 1 row whose width is w)
    (2). Then for n rows (without think unsafe cases), therefore g(n) = f(w)**n;
	(3). Think about every combination of safe(i) and unsafe(i-j), use DN to find all the values for h(1) until h(n-1)
	h[i] = g[i] - Sum of (h[j] * g[i-j]), j is [1, i-1]

Key point: Use [Pre Sum Arr] and [bottom up] idea, previous player is actuallly a different    
           way of showing first player. 
		   
[Xor and Sum]
My solution: When the bits that b shifted is more than a length, then a^b = a + b;
             Based on that, I can deduce the result.
