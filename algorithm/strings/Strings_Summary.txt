1. [HackerRank in a String]
   Easy: just use greedy way to solve the task, the partial best result will be part of global best result.
   
2. [Bear and Steady Gene]
   Kind of tough   

3. [Highest Value Palindrome]
   It's quite straightforward, key points are:
   (1). First, count the minimum required changes for input string to be a palindrome, if the value > k, then return -1;
   (2). Else change input string into palindrome and change to 9 when possible.   
   There are 2 edge cases:
   (1). Input string length is 1 like '5';
   (2). Input string is already a palindrome and k is 1, like '131'
   
4. [Maximum Palindromes] 
   (1). Must have combination knowledge to find the correct answer;
   (2). Use BigInt for very big number.
   When try to improve performance to pass left tests, need to be familiar with below knowledge:
   (1). Modular multiplicative inverse
   (2). Exponentiation by squaring, in C# there is BigInteger.ModPow(base, exponent, modulus) method for it.
