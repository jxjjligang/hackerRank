1. [Counter game]  
   It's quite straightforward.
   But when read Editorial, I still learn many. When implement in JavaScript, found bit operation applies to 32 bit signed integer;
   Therefore, BigInt type must be used to achieve expected result.

2. [Cipher]
   Find a way that gradualy introduce the effect of bit(s) of original number, like
   step 1 only 1 bit of original number is introduced, so the original bit can be easily deduced;
   step 2 only introduce the bit found in step 1 and bit (after or before) it, so the next bit can be deduced also.
   step by step, we will deduce all the bits of the original number.
