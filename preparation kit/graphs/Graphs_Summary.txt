1. Roads and Libraries:
   The key point is how to split cities that connected (directly or indirectly) into graphs;
   Then for each graph, 
               let costLibs = graphLen * c_lib, costRoadAndLibs = c_lib + roadsLength * c_road;
               minCost += Math.min(costLibs, costRoadAndLibs);
