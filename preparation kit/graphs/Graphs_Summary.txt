1. Roads and Libraries:
   The key point is how to split cities that connected (directly or indirectly) into graphs;
   Then for each graph, 
               let costLibs = graphLen * c_lib, costRoadAndLibs = c_lib + roadsLength * c_road;
               minCost += Math.min(costLibs, costRoadAndLibs);
			   
2. Find the nearest clone:
   The key point is for each node that has TARGET value, use BFS or DFS to find another node has TARGET value; 			   
       and finally returns the minimum value of them;
   If choose to use BFS, push the queue with object {node: nodeIndex, depth: depth value from top node} will help.

3. BFS: Shortest Reach in a Graph
   Simple: just use BFS to get the depth value from the start node
