1. [Height of a Binary Tree]
   Use recursive method call to find answer

2. [Lowest Common Ancestor]
   Still use recursive method call to find answer.
   
3. [Is This a Binary Search Tree]
   Still use recursive idea to check each node's data within range (minValue, maxValue)

4. [Huffman Decoding]
   In while loop, read decoded string one by one and move node to the left (when read 0) 
   or to the right (while read 1), if leaf node is reached, add it to the final string and 
   reset node to root.
