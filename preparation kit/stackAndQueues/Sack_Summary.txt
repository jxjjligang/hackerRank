	Queues: A Tale of Two Stacks:
	        Create 2 stack: enqueue_statck and dequeue_statck;
			For enqueue operation, push value into enqueue_statck, for dequeue operation, pops all the values from enqueue_statck into dequeue_statck, then pop dequeue_statck;
			For print operation, print dequeue_statck if it has value, else move values from enqueue_statck into dequeue_statck and print the top value of dequeue_statck.
