1. [Max Array Sum]
   #1 Use iteration to accumulate the final result from previously calculated partial result;
   #2 Read backwards array, when read last number, calculate result for array that has only one number; 
      when read last 2 numbers, calculate result for array that has 2 numbers; so on so forth.

2. [Abbreviation]	 
   It's straightforward to use recursion, but it's not performant to pass all the tests.
   Therefore, we can use iteration to get the answer, in a very similar way to get [Common Child String] from 2 strings.
