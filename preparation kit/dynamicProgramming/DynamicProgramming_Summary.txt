1. [Max Array Sum]
   #1 Use iteration to accumulate the final result from previously calculated partial result;
   #2 Read backwards array, when read last number, calculate result for array that has only one number; 
      when read last 2 numbers, calculate result for array that has 2 numbers; so on so forth.

2. [Abbreviation]	 
   It's straightforward to use recursion, but it's not performant to pass all the tests.
   Therefore, we can use iteration to get the answer, in a very similar way to get [Common Child String] from 2 strings.
   
3. [Candies]   
   Key point:
   (1). Find 3 cases when compare new grade with previous grade
	    # 1 new grade  >  previous grade 
	    # 2 new grade === previous grade
	    # 3 new grade  <  previous grade
   (2). Create stack for saving candies allocated, eventually adds up to the total candies amount variable.
