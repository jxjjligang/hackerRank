1. [2D Array]:
   Simple: Iteration within iteration.

2. [Left Rotation]
   Simple: copy 2 parts of original array, then mgerge the 2 parts together.
   
3. [New Year Chaos]
   Iterate arr from the last to first, for current item, check if it's bribe result 
   case 1: its value - index > 3, bribe more than 2 which is not allowed and return 'Too chaotic';
   case 2: its value - index in (1,2), then sway it with right neighbour and re-set the iteration index.
   
4. [Minimum Swaps 2]
   Iterate the array, check each item value at index is i+1 or not, if not find the position that has
   value i+1 and sway with it.
   To increase the performance, create a map value2Index and maintain it during swap.

5. [Array Manipulation]   
   Key point (based on the idea from discussion): 
   (1). Create a RangeArray, its length will be the max value of queries[1];
   (2). Iterate queries, for each item, set RangeArray[fromIndex] += queries[i][0], RangeArray[toIndex] -= queries[i][1];
   (3). Iterate RangeArray from the second item, rangeArr[i] += rangeArr[i-1]
